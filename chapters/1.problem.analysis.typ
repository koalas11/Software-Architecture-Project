= Remote Health Monitoring and Telerehabilitation System

A remote health monitoring and telerehabilitation system must be designed and implemented for patients preparing for surgery. Patients must be monitored for physiological parameters and for compliance with daily life activities, including verifying that the patient performs the activities prescribed in the rehabilitation plan. If any detected parameters exceed certain thresholds, the system must send an alert to the attending physician, who must then contact the patient by phone.

The telemonitoring system must be designed to:

1. Acquire sensor data "in real time" according to the schedule defined by the patient's therapeutic plan.

2. Support the physician in redefining the therapeutic plan (including changes to the frequency of physiological parameter monitoring).

3. Automatically implement the updated therapeutic plan.

4. Detect abnormal situations (physiological parameter values outside the thresholds).

5. In case of abnormal situations, identify an on-call physician to visit the patient in person. In case of an alarm situation (e.g., red code), identify the nearest ambulance and hospital to transport the patient.

6. Notify the identified on-call physician by sending the patient's medical record.

7. Allow the on-call physician to send the detected parameters, diagnosis, and other health-related information.

8. Acquire information from the tracking platform about the patient's daily life activities.

9. At the end of the day, verify whether the patient actually performed the rehabilitation exercises at the scheduled times.

== System Assumptions

Based on the requirements analysis, the following assumptions guide the system's design and constraints:

=== Operational Environment

*Geographic Scope*: The system operates within Italy's healthcare infrastructure, complying with the regulatory framework applicable to remote health monitoring and telerehabilitation under the Italian National Health Service (Servizio Sanitario Nazionale). This includes adherence to European GDPR regulations and Italian medical device certification requirements.

*Healthcare Infrastructure Integration*: Based on the Annuario Statistico del Servizio Sanitario Nazionale - Anno 2023 @italian-health-stats-2023, the system should consider integration with Italy's 29,386 healthcare institutions, including 996 public hospitals, 9,121 private accredited facilities, and various specialized clinics distributed across the country. This geographical distribution influences the system's deployment architecture and emergency response coordination capabilities.

*Healthcare Provider Capacity*: The system could accommodate approximately 413,475 physicians across Italy, including general practitioners, specialists, and surgeons @italian-health-stats-2023.

=== Healthcare Data Decentralization and Interoperability Considerations

While not directly related to the core architectural requirements of this remote monitoring system, one might consider that a decentralized healthcare system architecture could potentially support comprehensive healthcare data sharing and analysis, which are increasingly recognized as critical aspects for advancing medical research and improving patient outcomes. This approach has been effectively demonstrated by contemporary European healthcare initiatives that show the feasibility of secure, privacy-compliant distributed healthcare data analytics.

The BETTER (Better real-world health-data distributed analytics research platform) project, funded by the European Union's Horizon program, provides evidence that decentralized healthcare infrastructure can successfully enable healthcare professionals to exploit the potential of large-scale, multi-source health data while maintaining strict privacy compliance @better-health-project. The project has developed a decentralized infrastructure that allows researchers and healthcare professionals to analyze distributed health datasets across national borders using AI-driven tools, all while remaining fully compliant with GDPR privacy guidelines.

This approach supports the architectural consideration that distributed processing capabilities can effectively balance the need for comprehensive healthcare data analysis with stringent privacy and regulatory requirements. The success of the BETTER project across multiple European medical centers demonstrates that a proposed decentralized architecture for remote patient monitoring could align with proven methodologies for secure, cross-border healthcare data utilization while maintaining high standards of patient privacy protection.

Furthermore, the broader European Health Data Space (EHDS) initiative reinforces this approach by establishing "a common framework and infrastructure for the use of health data for research, innovation, policy-making, and regulatory activities in the European Union" while ensuring that "citizens can securely access and exchange their health data wherever they are in the EU". These initiatives collectively suggest that distributed healthcare architectures might successfully support both individual patient care and population-level health analytics without compromising data security or regulatory compliance.
